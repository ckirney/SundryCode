      # This applies Delaunay triangulation to a surface.  This will return a set of ordered points which define the triangles on the surface.  These triangles can then be used to define subsurfaces or new surfaces.
      # Surfaces and subsurfaces are not returned since they may not be needed nor wanted.

  def self.get_guaranteed_concave_surfaces(surface)
    # Note that points on surfaces are given counterclockwise when looking at the surface from the opposite direction as
    # the outward normal (i.e. the outward normal is pointing at you).  I use point_a1, point_a2, point_b1 and point b2
    # lots.  For this, point_a refers to vectors pointing up.  In this case point_a1 is at the top of the vector and
    # point_a2 is at the bottom of the vector.  Contrarily, point_b refers to vectors pointing down.  In this case
    # point_b1 is at the bottom of the vector and point_b2 is at the top.  All of this comes about because I cycle
    # through the points starting at the 2nd point and and going to the last point.  I count vectors as starting from
    # the last point and going toward the current point.
    # See following where P1 through P4 are the points.  When cycling through a is where you start and b is where you
    # end.  the o is the tip of the outward normal pointing at you.
